# About Neurture:

Neurture will be a website detailing milestones in brain development, accomanying them with a 3-D visual display of their corresponding developmental areas in the brain. Tips for nurturing development at each age range will also be available.

# How to Use:

The user will be able to select a particular age range of interest using a scrollbar. Once the desired age range is selected, the user can hover over a developmental milestone in order to visualize active regions in the 3-D brain display. Conversely, the user will also be able hover over the brain display to view prime areas of development during a selected age range.

# Resources:

In order to achieve 3-D brain imaging, Neurture will use the following brain imaging API:

-BranBrowser v.2.5.0 (https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/#documentation) 


A variety of brain research texts are also being used to compile the descriptions and tips for each milestone. These will be listed at a later date.
